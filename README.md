# First Microcontroller

This is just a simple PCB design to breakout an [ATmega32U4](https://ww1.microchip.com/downloads/en/devicedoc/atmel-7766-8-bit-avr-atmega16u4-32u4_datasheet.pdf) and with minimal circuitry to allow for safe USB-C usage. All other pins are either broken out to a 2x13 GPIO header or a 2x3 ICSP (programming) header.

## More info 
I will eventually write up a small post about this controller and have some pictures of the final design/physical project at my website https://spencerlommel.com
